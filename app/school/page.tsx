                    This is the part of Greyletters where I talk about school.<br />
                    Not the pretty version adults fantasize about.<br />
                    Not the nostalgia they cling to.<br />
                    Not the fake speeches about opportunity and growth.<br />
                    I am talking about the real thing.<br />
                    The version students actually live.<br />
                    <span className="text-white">The pressure chamber.</span><br />
                    The place where too many young people learn pain before they even understand what pain is.

                <p>
                    School is supposed to be a place where you learn.<br />
                    But for a lot of us, it becomes the first place where something inside us cracks.<br />
                    The first place where we learn how to hide emotions.<br />
                    The first place where we learn that exhaustion is normal.<br />
                    The first place where we learn that worth is measured by performance.<br />
                    The first place where we learn to be afraid of failure.

                        School teaches you how to sit still when your mind is screaming.<br />
                        School teaches you how to obey even when something feels wrong.<br />
                        School teaches you to compete instead of connect.<br />
                        School teaches you that mistakes define you.<br />
                        School teaches you that work matters more than health.<br />
                        School teaches you that being human is inconvenient.

                    Nobody teaches you how to recognize burnout.<br />
                    Nobody teaches you how to ask for help.<br />
                    Instead you learn how to carry everything alone.<br />
                    You learn to fight through exhaustion.<br />
                    You learn that needing rest is a flaw.

                <p>
                    Students come in full of curiosity, energy, ideas.<br />
                    And year by year, the system takes that and replaces it with pressure.<br />
                    Pressure to be perfect.<br />
                    Pressure to achieve.<br />
                    Pressure to stay silent.<br />
                    Pressure to be someone you are not.

                <p>
                    School is one of the first institutions that fails children.<br />
                    But it is not the only one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a reason the damage feels so deep.<br />
                    Because school is surrounded by systems that fail in their own ways.
                </p>

                <p className="text-2xl text-white font-bold">Here is the truth.</p>

                {/* Parents Section */}
                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neon-primary pt-8">The failure of parents</h2>

                <p>
                    Most parents don&apos;t mean to hurt their kids.<br />
                    But intention does not erase impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Parents repeat the same phrases that broke generations before us.<br />
                    <span className="text-white italic">&quot;Be grateful&quot;</span><br />
                    <span className="text-white italic">&quot;Stop complaining&quot;</span><br />
                    <span className="text-white italic">&quot;Others have it worse&quot;</span><br />
                    <span className="text-white italic">&quot;When I was your age&quot;</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    They think they&apos;re helping.<br />
                    They think they&apos;re motivating.<br />
                    But what they really do is teach their children that their struggle is invalid.<br />
                    That their pain is a weakness.<br />
                    That their feelings are inconvenient.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many kids learn early that emotions are unacceptable.<br />
                    That they must hide anything that looks like weakness.<br />
                    That the only way to be loved is to perform well.<br />
                    That perfection is the bare minimum.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Parents wonder why their children don&apos;t talk to them.<br />
                    But they never look at the moments when the child tried to speak and got silence or judgment in return.<br />
                    They never see how easily they dismissed the feelings they should have protected.<br />
                    They never realize that the fear and pressure their child carries began under their own roof.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Parents fail not because they are bad people, but because they were never taught how to support a child emotionally.<br />
                        They were raised by the same system.<br />
                        <span className="text-white">And the cycle continues.</span>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neon-accent pt-8">The failure of the Ministry of Education</h2>

                <p>
                    If parents fail out of misunderstanding, ministries fail out of <span className="text-neon-accent">arrogance</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Ministry of Education is one of the most outdated institutions in existence.<br />
                    It protects its old methods like holy scripture.<br />
                    It refuses to evolve while pretending everything is fine.<br />
                    It ignores the fact that society, technology, mental health, and the world itself have completely changed.
                </p>

                <div className="p-6 bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-lg">
                    <p>
                        Students are drowning under workloads that make no sense.<br />
                        Teachers are overwhelmed and unsupported.<br />
                        Mental health is treated like a luxury.<br />
                        Schools have no training for dealing with real emotional issues.<br />
                        Curriculums are decades old.<br />
                        Expectations are unrealistic.<br />
                        Budgets are insufficient.<br />
                        <span className="text-neon-accent">And leadership pretends the problem is laziness.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Ministries brag about reforms that never work.<br />
                    They hold meetings instead of making change.<br />
                    They praise outdated traditions while students collapse under the pressure those traditions create.<br />
                    They care more about statistics than human lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And when students break, when students burn out, when students lose hope,<br />
                    the same ministry that ignored them calls it a tragedy<br />
                    <span className="text-white">as if they had no part in it.</span>
                </p>

                <p className="text-xl text-neon-accent font-medium">
                    But they did.<br />
